Each file in the repository contains some python code and instructions for solving some small exercises.

What I would like you to do is complete the exercises in each file, while using my site (instead of Google) to help you, if needed.

Please take note of how long it takes you to complete these challenges. If it is not possible to do it one sitting that is fine, just try and keep an accurate time record if possible.
